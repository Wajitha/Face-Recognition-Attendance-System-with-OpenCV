Face recognition technology involves analyzing and identifying a person’s facial features using advanced algorithms.
It captures and compares unique facial characteristics, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the face.

**This technology has come a long way and is now capable of near-instantaneous recognition with remarkable accuracy.
They use a camera to capture an individual’s face, analyze the facial features, and compare them with a database of pre-registered faces.
If a match is found, attendance is recorded. These systems can also adapt to variations in lighting, facial expressions, and aging, ensuring reliability.**
